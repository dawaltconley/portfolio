A set of sass tools for manipulating color attributes using CSS properties.

<!--
what does this allow? use of custom css properties for colors (theming)
with advantages of scss color manipulation (mixing, scaling, etc), now relative
to custom property values (changeable by class, JS)
-->

Fork of [kldkv/scss-properties](https://github.com/kldkv/scss-properties), with
significant updates, bringing it in line with the behavior of [sass color
functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color). Used as a
dependency of my sass-themes package.
