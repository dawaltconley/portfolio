A professional corporate website for a renewable energy development
company, which I designed and currently maintain. Optimized for
modern and legacy browsers like Internet Explorer, to meet the needs
of Onyx's customers.

I implemented a minor homepage redesign for the company's Movember
initiative, which is archived
[here](http://onyx-movember.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).
I also designed a real-time carbon offset calculator for the site
which tracks production in real time through a third-party API. Not
yet implemented, but
[previewed](http://onyx-carbon-offset.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/)
at the bottom of the homepage.

Wrote a serverless application to calculate and display a solar energy
companyâ€™s real-time carbon offset, translating live energy production data into
an animated split-flap counter.

First time challenges:

- massive liquid templates for image resizing?
