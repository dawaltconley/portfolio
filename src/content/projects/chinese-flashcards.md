A flashcard app for the vocabulary in Bryan Van Norden's _Classical 
Chinese for Everyone_. <!-- more --> I wrote it to help myself learn the 
material and I hope it will assist others in doing the same.

And to brush up on React, especially functional components.

Other:

- using tailwind to build a custom app UI
