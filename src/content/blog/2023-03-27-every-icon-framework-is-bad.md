Every icon framework is bad.

Or

What will I do to avoid a copy-paste workflow?

- iconify-react
- fontawesome-svg-core
- unplugin-icons
- astro-icon

Not interested in disparaging these projects, all of which I'm hopeful will someday make working with icons easier than it currently is. But every single one of them brings more-than-you-need to solve the following problem: it's a little anoying to copy and paste SVGs where you need them.

Almost all of them rely on RegExp parsing or string manipulation under the hood.
